/**
 * Attaches the CARTO API key to basemap tile URLs, when there is one.
 *
 * The key arrives as a build-time value (VITE_CARTO_API_KEY, threaded from the
 * droplet's gitignored env through the Dockerfile's frontend stage), which
 * means it is baked into the shipped bundle and readable by anyone who opens
 * devtools. That is the supported shape for a basemap token rather than a
 * mistake: tile requests are issued by the browser, so no server sits in the
 * path that could hold a secret. It does mean this must only ever carry a key
 * scoped to fetching tiles.
 *
 * Setting it is optional, and today it changes nothing. As of 2026-08-27 the
 * public raster endpoints under basemaps.cartocdn.com serve tiles anonymously
 * and ignore the parameter outright — a deliberately bogus api_key returns a
 * byte-identical tile — so this exists so that moving to a keyed endpoint or a
 * paid plan is a value change rather than a code change. Leave the build arg
 * unset and every URL below is passed through exactly as it was written.
